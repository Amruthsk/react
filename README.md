# React Mastery — Building Interactive Interfaces

This repository contains my study and projects in **React.js**, focusing on how to build reusable UI components and manage state with clarity.

### ⚛️ What's Inside:
- React fundamentals: JSX, Components, Props, State
- React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, etc.
- Component architecture and lifting state
- Real-world mini-apps: Todo App, Counter, API Fetching

> Each project builds a deeper mental model of how React works under the hood.
